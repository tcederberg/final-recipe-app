# Recipe App

This application is built with Python using the Django Framework. 
It allows users to create, manage, and search through a database of recipes, supporting full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. 
The app enables users to input detailed recipe information, such as ingredients, cooking times, and descriptions, and includes a search feature to find recipes based on ingredients. 
This project is part of my specialty course at CareerFoundry, focusing on leveraging Python with Django.
